        3. In .env file, define key-value pairs to be loaded into "process.env"
        4. In file "app.js" declare ==>> require('dotenv').config() ==>> to load any variables defined in ".env" into the "process.env" object

        1. Create ".gitignore" file
        2. Type ".env" to exclude .env files from Github repository
